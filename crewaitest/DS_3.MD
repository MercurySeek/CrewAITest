Okay, the user has asked me to present the complete PPT after refining it with more SCM examples and diagrams. Let me start by understanding what they need. They want a comprehensive slide deck that includes all the previous updates plus additional applications in supply chain management like inventory management, SKU forecasting, clustering, and OOS analysis. Also, they mentioned adding diagrams to clarify basic concepts.

First, I need to structure the PPT in a logical flow. The user already has an existing structure, so I'll build on that. Starting with the title slide, agenda, then diving into foundations, techniques, agents, knowledge graphs, future trends, and conclusion. The user wants more SCM-specific applications, so I'll need to insert new slides or modify existing ones to include these examples.

For each SCM application mentionedâ€”inventory management, SKU demand forecast, SKU clustering, OOS analysisâ€”I should create dedicated slides or subsections. Each of these should have a brief explanation, a code snippet if applicable, a case study or research reference, and a diagram. The diagrams are crucial here to make complex concepts clear, so I'll need to describe them even if they can't be visually included in text.

Looking at the previous interactions, the user provided code examples and external links. I'll follow that pattern, ensuring that each new application has similar supporting materials. For instance, inventory management could use a code snippet for demand forecasting with an LLM, reference a case study from a reputable company like Walmart, and include a flowchart showing how LLMs integrate with inventory systems.

SKU clustering might involve using embeddings from LLMs to group similar products. I can add a code example using clustering algorithms like K-means on top of LLM-generated embeddings. A diagram here could show how raw SKU data is processed into embeddings and then clustered.

Out-of-Stock (OOS) analysis could involve LLMs analyzing sales data and external factors to predict stockouts. A code example might involve querying an LLM with historical data and current trends, and a diagram could illustrate the workflow from data input to OOS prediction.

I also need to ensure that the PPT maintains a balance between technical depth and clarity. Each slide should have a clear title, concise bullet points, supporting documents, and visuals. The appendix slides should consolidate additional resources and references for further reading.

Another thing to consider is the flow of the presentation. The user might present this to a technical audience, so the slides should be detailed enough to showcase expertise but structured to guide the audience through each concept step-by-step. Adding QR codes for demos or repositories can enhance engagement, as the user mentioned in design tips.

I should check that all citations are properly formatted and that links are functional. Including datasets from Kaggle or academic sources adds credibility. For each new application, aligning it with existing techniques like RAG or knowledge graphs will show integration within the SCM context.

Finally, reviewing the entire deck to ensure consistency in formatting, such as hyperlink placement, QR codes, and footnote citations. Making sure that diagrams are described adequately so the user can create or source them appropriately. Also, verifying that all code snippets are relevant and demonstrate practical implementation.

In summary, the complete PPT will expand on the existing structure with new slides for each SCM application, enriched with examples, code, case studies, and diagrams. It should provide a thorough technical deep dive while maintaining clarity and engagement through visual aids and external resources.
