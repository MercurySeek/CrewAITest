Okay, let's see. The user wants me to add more detailed code examples in the presentation slides and include the diagram links after each diagram. They mentioned that previously, the diagrams weren't showing up, so I need to make sure those links are correct and accessible. 

First, I should go through each slide where there's code and expand those examples. The user specifically mentioned SCM applications like inventory management, SKU forecasting, clustering, and OOS analysis. I need to ensure the code examples are relevant to these areas. For instance, in inventory management, a more detailed Python script using specific libraries like pandas or scikit-learn might be helpful. 

Also, the user wants the diagram links to be added right after each diagram. In previous slides, I used Imgur links as placeholders. I need to check if those links are still valid or if there are better resources. Maybe creating a GitHub repository with the actual diagrams and linking to them there would be more reliable. Alternatively, using a service like Google Drawings or Lucidchart that allows for public sharing might work. 

Looking at the agent workflow slide, the code example uses CrewAI. I should expand that code to show more detailed setup, like how to define agents with specific tools and tasks. Including error handling or logging might add depth. Also, adding comments to explain each part of the code would make it clearer for the audience.

For SKU clustering, a code example using K-means or another clustering algorithm with real data preprocessing steps would be useful. Maybe include steps like normalizing data, choosing the number of clusters, and visualizing the results. 

In the knowledge graph slide, perhaps adding a snippet of how to create nodes and relationships using Neo4j's Cypher query language would illustrate the integration with LLMs. 

I should also make sure that all the links provided (like GitHub repos, datasets, and research papers) are up-to-date and relevant. If some links are placeholders, I need to replace them with actual resources or note that they're examples. 

Additionally, including a slide with setup instructions for the code examples, like installing necessary libraries (transformers, langchain, crewai, etc.), would help users replicate the examples. 

Finally, double-checking each slide for consistency in formatting, ensuring code blocks are properly syntax-highlighted, and diagrams are correctly placed and labeled. Making sure that the flow from one slide to the next is logical, especially after adding the new detailed content.

**Title**: Collaborative Agents for Resilient SCM  
**Code**: Full Inventory Replenishment Agent  
```python  
from crewai import Agent, Task  
from langchain.tools import GoogleSearchTool  

# Define Inventory Agent  
inventory_agent = Agent(  
  role="Inventory Manager",  
  goal="Prevent stockouts through dynamic replenishment",  
  tools=[  
    GoogleSearchTool(),  # Monitor market trends  
    SQLTool(query_db)    # Access sales data  
  ],  
  backstory="Specializes in demand forecasting and warehouse optimization",  
  verbose=True  
)  

# Define Procurement Agent  
procurement_agent = Agent(  
  role="Procurement Specialist",  
  goal="Ensure timely material supply",  
  tools=[  
    APITool(supplier_system),  # Supplier API integration  
    EmailTool()                # Communicate with vendors  
  ]  
)  

# Create Task  
replenishment_task = Task(  
  description="""  
  Current stock: SKU-4567 - 150 units (safety stock: 200).  
  Recent sales trend: +20% week-over-week.  
  Action: Calculate reorder quantity and coordinate with suppliers.  
  """,  
  expected_output="Purchase order for 300 units with delivery schedule",  
  agents=[inventory_agent, procurement_agent]  
)  

# Execute  
crew = Crew(agents=[inventory_agent, procurement_agent], tasks=[replenishment_task])  
result = crew.kickoff()  
```

### **Slide 3: SKU Clustering & Forecasting**  
**Code**: LLM-Powered SKU Segmentation  
```python  
import pandas as pd  
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans  
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer  

# 1. Generate SKU Embeddings  
model = SentenceTransformer('paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2')  
sku_descriptions = pd.read_csv("sku_descriptions.csv")["description"].tolist()  
embeddings = model.encode(sku_descriptions)  # 384-dim vectors  

# 2. Cluster SKUs  
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=8, random_state=42)  
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(embeddings)  

# 3. Analyze Clusters  
cluster_data = pd.DataFrame({  
  "SKU": sku_descriptions.index,  
  "Cluster": clusters,  
  "Sales": sales_data  
})  
print(cluster_data.groupby("Cluster")["Sales"].mean())  

# 4. Visualize (PCA reduced)  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA  
pca = PCA(n_components=2)  
vis_embeddings = pca.fit_transform(embeddings)  
plt.scatter(vis_embeddings[:,0], vis_embeddings[:,1], c=clusters)  
```

### **Slide 4: Knowledge Graph Construction**  
**Code**: Neo4j + LLM Integration  
```python  
from neo4j import GraphDatabase  
from langchain.chains import GraphCypherQAChain  

# 1. Initialize Neo4j Driver  
driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))  

# 2. Create Schema  
with driver.session() as session:  
  session.run("""  
    CREATE CONSTRAINT FOR (s:Supplier) REQUIRE s.id IS UNIQUE;  
    CREATE CONSTRAINT FOR (sku:SKU) REQUIRE sku.code IS UNIQUE;  
  """)  

# 3. LLM-Generated Cypher Queries  
chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm(  
  llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0),  
  graph=driver,  
  return_direct=True  
)  

response = chain.run("""  
  Find all SKUs using material 'organic_cotton' from suppliers in risk regions.  
""")  
print(response)
